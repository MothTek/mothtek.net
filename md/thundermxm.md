A TB3 MXM dock with support for full size MXM3.0b and Clevo-style cards! Native display outputs from the MXM card are broken out, as well as USB and PD back to the host device.

It's very WIP and the latest changes aren't on GitHub yet :( Hopefully soon!

# Specs:
* Intel JHL7440 TB3 module 
* MXM3.0b interface, with full support for Clevo power connectors
* PCIe 3.0 x4 link 
* All available I/O broken out:
    * 3x DP + 1x HDMI for monitor and VR headset support
    * USB3.0 downstream ports for various devices
* Dell-style 15A barrel jack connector
* Fan header with PWM control

This project wouldn't exist without the help of [wifi](https://github.com/a-little-wifi/) and her incredible [MXM Immobilizer project](https://github.com/a-little-wifi/mxm-immobilizer). I also stole the cool MXM outline from there :3
