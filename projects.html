				<p> Below is a list of our current projects. They are a mix of both Mothtek designs, as well as contracted designs. <br>
                    <br>
                    As you can see, we have no  real limits on what we might produce, and we encourage you to reach out even if it might be the silliest design possible. <br>

<h1 id="intro3"> RPI CM4 Compute Module Carrier: </h1>
<p> A small CM4 carrier board designed for portable use in a variety of form factors. <br>
    It features USB 3.0 (Type A and Type-C), HDMI and MIPI-DSI for a Nexus 7 touch panel,<br>
    20V USB-C PD negotiation, and hardware killswitches. <br>
    It is currently a work in progress, however it is nearing the completion phase and <br> 
    awaiting a redesign of the LiPo charge circuitry. Prototypes are expected before July. <br>

<h1 id="intro3"> Project Dark Wing ADAHRS:</h1>
<p> A project to provide a low cost, open source ADAHRS solution for light aircraft. <br>
    Utilizing the high performance PIC64GX MPU, with discrete FPGAs for each radio interface. <br>
    More details to come <br>

<h1 id="intro3"> bugboard-1 D2000 mITX motherboard:</h1>
<p> An attempt to produce a desktop mITX motherboard using the Phytium D2000 CPU. This <br>
    board will feature typical desktop motherboard I/O, including USB 3.0 and PCIe x16, and <br>
    will support EDK2. This project is in the initial stages. <br>

<h1 id="intro3"> MXM Thunderbolt 3 dock:</h1>
<p> A TB3 compliant docking station for a mobile MXM GPU. Featuring support for both <br>
    standard MXM3.0b and Clevo MXM3.0b cards, and up to 200W of power, with all available <br>
    display outputs broken out, and 65W PD supplied to the host device. Work is currently <br>
    ongoing on this board, with prototype hardware expected by July.<br>

<h1 id="intro3"> lacewing-1 CH592 BLE UART:</h1>
<p> A tiny CH592 board for remote UART debugging over BLE. Built to be as small as it can<br>
    possibly be, this board can fit in almost any problematic device and give you a remote <br>
    UART console on any device! <br>
    Coming very soon!<br>

<h1 id="intro3"> ccd-tiny Chromebook CCD debuggers:</h1>
<p> A small dual port CCD trigger for Chromebooks with the CC50 debug chip. This adapter <br>
    allows for both CCD debugging, and ADB access. This is based on the SuzyQable design with <br>
    some tweaks. You can also boot from USB and still have CCD functionality on devices with <br>
    limited I/O :) <br>
    Coming very soon!<br>
